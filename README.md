# Block-removed Knowledge-distilled Stable Diffusion Model (BK-SDM)

This is the official codebase for [BK-SDM: Architecturally Compressed Stable Diffusion for Efficient Text-to-Image Generation](https://openreview.net/forum?id=bOVydU0XKC), which has been accepted to [ICCV 2023 Demo Track](https://iccv2023.thecvf.com/) and [ICML 2023 Workshop on ES-FoMo](https://es-fomo.com/).


BK-SDMs are lightweight text-to-image synthesis models, achieved by compressing [Stable Diffusion v1.4](https://huggingface.co/CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4): 
  - Certain residual and attention blocks are eliminated from the U-Net of SDM-v1.4.
  - Distillation pretraining is conducted with very limited training data, but it (surprisingly) remains effective.


## Installation
```bash
conda create -n bk-sdm python=3.8
conda activate bk-sdm
git clone https://github.com/Nota-NetsPresso/BK-SDM.git
cd BK-SDM
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Minimal Example with ðŸ¤—[Diffusers](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers)

With the default PNDM scheduler and 50 denoising steps:
```python
import torch
from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline

pipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained("nota-ai/bk-sdm-small", torch_dtype=torch.float16)
pipe = pipe.to("cuda")

prompt = "a golden vase with different flowers"
image = pipe(prompt).images[0]  
    
image.save("example.png")
```
<details>
<summary>An equivalent code, which modifies solely the U-Net of SDM-v1.4 while preserving its Text Encoder and Image Decoder:</summary>

```python
import torch
from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline, UNet2DConditionModel

pipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained("CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4", torch_dtype=torch.float16)
pipe.unet = UNet2DConditionModel.from_pretrained("nota-ai/bk-sdm-small", subfolder="unet", torch_dtype=torch.float16)
pipe = pipe.to("cuda")

prompt = "a golden vase with different flowers"
image = pipe(prompt).images[0]  
    
image.save("example.png")
```

</details>


## Evaluation on MS-COCO Benchmark
We used the following codes to obtain the results on MS-COCO. After generating 512Ã—512 images with the PNDM scheduler and 25 denoising steps, we downsampled them to 256Ã—256 for computing scores.

### Code (using [BK-SDM-Small](https://huggingface.co/nota-ai/bk-sdm-small) as default)

(1) Download `metadata.csv` and `real_im256.npz`:
  ```bash
  bash scripts/get_mscoco_files.sh

  # ./data/mscoco_val2014_30k/metadata.csv: 30K prompts from the MS-COCO validation set (used in '(2)')  
  # ./data/mscoco_val2014_41k_full/real_im256.npz: FID statistics of 41K real images (used in '(3)')
  ```

(2) Generate 512Ã—512 images over 30K prompts from the MS-COCO validation set â†’ Resize them to 256Ã—256:
  ```bash
  python3 src/generate.py 

  # For the other models, use the followings:
  # python3 src/generate.py --model_id nota-ai/bk-sdm-base --save_dir ./results/bk-sdm-base
  # python3 src/generate.py --model_id nota-ai/bk-sdm-tiny --save_dir ./results/bk-sdm-tiny  
  ```

(3) Compute FID, IS, and CLIP score:
  ```bash
  bash scripts/eval_scores.sh

  # For the other models, modify the `./results/bk-sdm-*` path in the scripts to specify different models.
  ```
Note
- Following the evaluation protocol [[DALLÂ·E](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.12092), [Imagen](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11487)], the FID stat for real images was computed over the full validation set (41K images) of MS-COCO. A precomputed stat file is downloaded via '(1)' at `./data/mscoco_val2014_41k_full/real_im256.npz`.
  - Additionally, `real_im256.npz` can be computed with `python3 src/get_stat_mscoco_val2014.py`, which downloads the whole images, resizes them to 256Ã—256, and computes the FID stat.
- On a single 3090 GPU, '(2)' takes about 10 hours per model, and '(3)' takes a few minutes.

  - A free CPU is commonly used for the demo to control expensesðŸ˜…; but we sometimes switch to T4 during special events.


## Model Description

### U-Net Architecture
We removed several residual and attention blocks from the 0.86B-parameter U-Net in the 1.04B-param SDM-v1.4, and our compressed models are summarized as follows.
- [0.76B-param **BK-SDM-Base**](https://huggingface.co/nota-ai/bk-sdm-base) (0.58B-param U-Net): obtained with â‘  fewer blocks in outer stages.
- [0.66B-param **BK-SDM-Small**](https://huggingface.co/nota-ai/bk-sdm-small) (0.49B-param U-Net): obtained with â‘  and â‘¡ mid-stage removal.
- [0.50B-param **BK-SDM-Tiny**](https://huggingface.co/nota-ai/bk-sdm-tiny) (0.33B-param U-Net): obtained with â‘ , â‘¡, and â‘¢ further inner-stage removal.

### Distillation Pretraining
The compact U-Net was trained to mimic the behavior of the original U-Net. We leveraged feature-level and output-level distillation, along with the denoising task loss.
